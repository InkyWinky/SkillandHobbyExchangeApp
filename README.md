 ## Hobbies with the power of exchange.
 
**About** <br>
Have you ever had a skill you wanted to learn really badly? Have you tried self-teaching yourself the skill, but finding yourself stuck, or improving too slowly? You're not the only one. Hob^(ex) connects you to other people with the same problem. On this website, you can add the skills or hobbies that you want to learn to your profile, as well as the skills you already know. Then, it matches you with other people who are good at the hobby you want to learn, and can teach you that hobby in exchange for you teaching them the hobby you're good at.
 
**Website structure**  <br>
The website is built as a combination of html/css/js and React.js. The landing page is a static HTML website that redirects to a react application, which has messaging and matching capabilities.

**Intended sequence of events**  <br>
Start the react app with npm start. In the future, the plan is to have the app hosted on a public url. Go to the landingPage folder, and open the index.html file there in the browser, to view the landing page if you want to see it. From there you can navigate to the react app that has the core functionalities of this web application.

**Current features**  <br>
Direct Messaging  <br>
Registration  <br>
Profile-creation  <br>
Matching algorithm <br>

**Future planned features**  <br>
Video and voice calling  <br>
Discovering new hobbies  <br>
More responsive  <br>
...and more!
